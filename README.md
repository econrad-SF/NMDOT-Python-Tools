# NMDOT-Python-Tools
Python scripts and geoprocessing tools. 

I work in the GIS Unit at New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT), supporting various DOT programs including drainage, environment, and planning. The code included here is from python toolboxes (ESRI ArcGIS vernacular) to aid the environment department when they do consultation with tribes, seeking their input on NMDOT projects that may have ground disturbance.
